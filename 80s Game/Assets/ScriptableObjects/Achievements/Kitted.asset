    Device has been done with PowerCore compatibility in mind. Using the data and
    auxiliary energy provided by the PowerCore, the Recovery Device\u2019s performance
    can be vastly increased in myriad ways. These expanded capabilities drain PowerCores
    dramatically, however, and the effects can only be sustained briefly.\r"
