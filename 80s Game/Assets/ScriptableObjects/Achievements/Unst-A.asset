  descriptionText: "Field Applications R&D Entry 9:\r\nDevelopment on the leader
    module has proved extremely problematic. The sudden deactivation of a leader
    unit often causes uncontrollable system failure in nearby bat robots. To make
    matters worse, these effects propagate in chains - other affected leader units
    also emit their own shutdown signal, causing cascade failure. The cause of this
    behavior is currently unknown.\r"
